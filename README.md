# Classification

This repository summarizes some of the widely-used classifiers such as Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, and KNN. These summaries are result of my readings from the ISL book. Just wanted to share my notes with the community! ISL book is fantastic starting point for new learners. The authors did a very good job delivering the intuitions behind the methods.
